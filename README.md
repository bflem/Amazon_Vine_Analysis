# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to discover if there is any bias in reviews written by paid reviews versus unpaid reviewers.

## Results
* In the filtered dataset, there were 7 Vine reviews and 105,979 non-Vine reviews.
* There were 0 Vine 5-star reviews and 67,580 non-Vine 5-star reviews.
* 0% of Vine reviews were 5-stars and 64% of non-Vine reviews were 5-stars

## Summary
I do not believe there is any positivity bias with the Vine reviews since none of them had 5 stars. 99% of the helpful reviews were from non-Vine reviewers, and the majority of the 5 star reviews were from non-Vine reviewers as well. An additional analysis that I could do is to look at the percentage of Vine reviewers that gave 4-star reviews because that number could change or further support my analysis. I believe most people would consider a 4-star review to still be positive.
